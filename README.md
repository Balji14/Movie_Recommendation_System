## 🧠 How the Recommendation Works

1. Movie metadata is vectorized (offline)
2. Cosine similarity is calculated between movies
3. A similarity matrix is stored using Pickle
4. When a user enters a movie name:
   - The closest matching title is found
   - Top **5 most similar movies** are recommended

> ⚠️ This system does **not** use user ratings or collaborative filtering.
